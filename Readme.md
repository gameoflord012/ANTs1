## Use Intention-Revealing Names
The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It
should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. 

## Avoid Disinformation
1. Avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code:

   > Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an `accountList` unless itâ€™s actually a `List`.
The word **list** means something specific to programmers

2. Beware of using names which vary in small ways: 

   > How long does it take to spot the subtle difference between a `XYZControllerForEfficientHandlingOfStrings` in one module
and, somewhere a little more distant, `XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings`?
